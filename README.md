# jQueryAssessment
Hey Everyone!

Here is your assessment challenge!

When the page loads, have a button on the DOM that says 'generate'. Upon clicking on that button, append a new container onto the DOM. That container should have two buttons, one that reads 'delete', the other that reads 'change'. Additionally, there should be text that provides a number. The number should be the number of times the 'generate row' button has been clicked.

The delete button should delete JUST the container that the button is in. The change button should change the background-color of the container to red. The default or 'normal' state of the background-color should be yellow. Clicking the button a second time should change it back to yellow, 3rd time red, 4th time yellow, etc. 

Do not add in anything additional beyond what is required. The goal is not to be clever here, it is simply to execute on the provided instructions.

Once you are complete, check your work into a new repo and post it on GitHub. Then reply to this email, CC'ing Kris and matthewbankston@gmail.com with the location of that repo.

A friendly reminder that this is simply a way for us to see how you are individually doing with the technology. If this is no problem, great. If you are struggling with it, get done what you can and still submit. This assessment is not an indicator of how you will perform post Prime or a measure of overall success thus far. 

Just relax and show us what you know!

You have an hour.
Thanks and good luck!
